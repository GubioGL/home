## [About Me](https://gubiogl.github.io/home/About-me.html)

I am Phd studenty with focused on applying quantum and classical artificial intelligence to solve optimization problems and differential equations.

## Key Skills
- 🖥️ Quantum Computing: Continuous variable quantum computing
- 🌌 Quantum Machine Learning: Quantum neural network
- 💡 Machine Learning: Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, Scikit-learn, other
- 🧠 Neural Networks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- 🎯 Problem Solving: Hard problems in physics, quantum mechanics, algebra, and advanced math. Numerical methods for solving differential equations

## Programming Language

- 🐍 Python (+5 years)
- 🖋️ C++ (~1 year)
- ☕ Java (~6 months)

## My programming work

- [Repository about Pytorch ](https://gubiogl.github.io/Aprendendo_pytorch/)

  In this repository there are some introductory steps with step-by-step instructions on how to program a neural network for regression and classification problems, using CPU and GPU.
  
- [Learning Machine Learning](https://gubiogl.github.io/Phd_ML/)

  This repository is dedicated to my study of Machine Learning.
  
- [Q-BASIC](https://github.com/GubioGL/Q-BASIC)

  This repository contains my own programming language for quantum computation, quantum algorithm and quantum optics simulation make in Python.
  
- [Feixes-pacialmente-coerentes](https://github.com/GubioGL/Q-BASIC)

  This repository is a series of Jupyter notebooks dedicated to teaching how to simulate Partially Coherent Beam in Python.
